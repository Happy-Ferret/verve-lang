Verve is a functional language for the working hacker. It was designed with users that come from other language paradigms in mind (primarily object-oriented). It aims to ease the path into the functional programming world by offering a more familiar take on functional idioms, like you'd find in most modern languages.

Verve has lists, classes, objects, lambdas, interfaces and more, and it tries to give them all a beginner-friendly API, but all the concepts found here have can be expressed in purely functional languages.
